# Multi Asteroid Hazard Feature Prediction

## Overview
This GitHub repository hosts a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and visualizations dedicated to the analysis and prediction of asteroid hazards. The primary objectives of this project include data cleaning, hazard classification, and orbit clustering of asteroids. The tools and methodologies employed in the notebooks aim to provide insights into potential asteroid hazards and contribute to our understanding of their characteristics.

## Project Structure

### 1. `code` Directory
This directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks responsible for various aspects of the project.

#### a. `Asteroid_Hazard_Classification.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on the classification of asteroid hazards. It likely contains code related to machine learning models, feature extraction, and evaluation metrics for hazard prediction.

#### b. `Data_Cleaning_Asteroid_Features.ipynb`
The data cleaning process is crucial for accurate analysis. This notebook should cover the steps taken to clean and preprocess the asteroid features data.

#### c. `Hazard_Classification.ipynb`
Building on the first notebook, this one might delve deeper into the hazard classification process. It could include more advanced models, parameter tuning, and additional visualizations.

#### d. `Orbit_Clustering.ipynb`
Orbit clustering is a significant aspect of the project. This notebook is likely dedicated to grouping asteroids based on their orbits. Expect to find clustering algorithms, visualizations, and interpretations.

### 2. `result` Directory
This directory contains visualizations and results obtained from the analysis.

#### a. `Hazard Classification`
- `hazard accuracy.png`: Visualization depicting the accuracy of hazard classification. This can provide a quick overview of the model's performance.
- `hazard cf.png`: Confusion matrix visualizing the classification results. It helps to understand false positives, false negatives, etc.

#### b. `Orbit Clustering`
- `2D.png`: A 2D visualization of asteroid orbits after clustering. This can offer insights into the spatial distribution of different asteroid groups.
- `3D.png`: A 3D visualization for a more comprehensive understanding of the orbit clustering results.

## Getting Started
To run the notebooks and replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
